Fingerprint Indexing using Extended Set Delaunay Traiangulation

Proposed and implemented a new indexing algorithm based on minutia triangulation which reduced the search time for fingerprint matching. Algorithm achieved a hit rate of 99.5% at very low penetration rate of 6.023.

"Classification of Extended Delaunay Triangulation for Fingerprint Indexing" was selected for  8th International Asia Modeling Symposium held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The paper can be accessed here : http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7079291/
